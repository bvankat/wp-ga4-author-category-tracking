# Wordpress Author and Category Tracking for Google Analytics (GA4)

#### Add custom dimensions to your GA4 instance to track post authors and post categories.

1. In your GA4 instance, you'll need to add custom dimensions for "post_author" and "post_category." (Admin > Data Display > Custom definitions). For each dimension, set the Scope to "Event."
2. Install and activate the plugin.

Plugin could pretty easily be expanded to include other WP variables beyond author and categories.
